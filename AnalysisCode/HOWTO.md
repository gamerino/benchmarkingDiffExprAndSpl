Analysis steps performed to compare the results of DIE and DS pipelines. Note that all scripts had definitions about files location that you need to change BEFORE their uses. The described analysis should be performed after the application of the DIE and DS pipelines.

The steps are 

1-  Load the packages and functions required to perform the comparison.

2-	Comparison of DIE pipelines with the `DIEComparison.R` script.  

3-  Comparison of DS workflows with the `DSComparison.R` script.

4- Build the paper figures with the `figures.R` script.
